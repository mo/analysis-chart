# analysis-chart.js

Analysis Chart is monolithic Javascript chart component (composed from multiple
[Rickshaw](https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw) components) that plots
timeseries, has a zoom slider, a legend and offers some auxiliary functionality
like showing the absolute/percentage diffs for a selected range.

It is used for visualizing data in the
[git-source-metrics](https://github.com/mo/git-source-metrics) and
[command-metrics](https://github.com/mo/command-metrics) programs, and it's not
really meant to be used outside of that context.
