# analysis-chart.js

Analysis Chart is monolithic Javascript chart component that plots timeseries,
has a zoom slider, a legend and offers some auxiliary functionality like showing
the absolute/percentage diffs for a selected range. It is used for visualizing
data in the [git-source-metrics](https://github.com/mo/git-source-metrics) and
[command-metrics programs](https://github.com/mo/command-metrics), and it's not
really meant to be used outside of that context.
